			<h2>To bring the glory of God to the Prospect Avenue community by reflecting the values of God’s Kingdom.</h2>
			<p>Charlottesville Abundant Life Ministries (CALM) is a partnership among the residents of the Prospect Avenue neighborhood (including Greenstone on 5th Apartments, Prospect & Orangedale Avenues, Bailey Road, and 7 1/2 Street) and volunteers from local churches and area nonprofits. The partnership began in 1995 when members from Trinity Presbyterian Church and community residents started praying together for change. Together, we desire to address spiritual, educational, and economic needs by offering Christ-centered programs and by sharing our lives together.</p>

			<h1>Our History</h1>
		<div id="text2">
			<h2>CALM developed initially as a partnership between Trinity Presbyterian Church and leaders in the former Blue Ridge Commons (now Greenstone on Fifth) community. </h2>
			<p>The Community Leadership Team (CLT), composed of six neighborhood residents and eight Trinity members, met throughout 1995 to assess the needs and assets of the Prospect community and formulate plans for an on-site Christian community center. Former Residents Association President Lula Rogers (pictured at left in 1996) and Trinity member Amy Sherman co-chaired the CLT. The design of the ministry was influenced by research on church-based urban ministries that Sherman was completing at the time (which is summarized in her book, Restorers of Hope). Drawing on the lessons learned from effective ministries around the nation, and on comments solicited by neighborhood residents when the Community Leadership Team completed a house-to-house survey in Blue Ridge Commons, the Abundant Life Family Center opened its doors June 14, 1996.</p>

			<h1>Our Community</h1>
		<div id="text3">
			<h2>Prospect is a diverse neighborhood of nearly 400 families, primarily African-American but with increasing numbers of Latinos and African and Asian refugees. </h2>
			<p>Community assets include a Resident’s Council, the Prospect Prayer Group (weekly prayer meetings and monthly worship services), Greenstone on 5th Apartments (HUD funded) and its Neighborhood Network Center, Forest Hills Park, Buford Middle School, Cherry Avenue Boys & Girls Club, Smith Aquatic and Fitness Center, proximity to the University of Virginia and its hospital, and the Abundant Life Family Center. The Prospect/Orangedale community is one of five federally-defined low income neighborhoods in the city of Charlottesville. Nearly half of the adult residents have not completed high school; unemployment and underemployment are common. About 70% percent of the residents are among the “working poor;” 30% are fully reliant on public assistance. Sometimes drug trafficking is observable in the community with violence occasionally erupting; at other times, seasons of relative calm prevail.</p>
